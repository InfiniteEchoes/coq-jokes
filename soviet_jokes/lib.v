  (* Presumed steps for the whole proof:
  1.  [assumption] we first assume that the description in sentence 2 means poor for simplicity
  2.  [assumption] we want to prove someone is making an unexpected answer. we assume
                   that if the poor description is in some sentence, that sentence is 
                   making a choice
  3.  [assumption] we assume that the behavior of making choice implies providing a reason
  4.  [assumption] if someone is providing a reason to that question, and that reason contains
                   the poor description, he is making an unexpected answer
  5.  [sentence 2, 1] 2nd sentence contains poor description
  6.  [5, 2] 2nd sentence is making a choice
  7.  [6, 3] 2nd sentence is providing a reason
  8.  [sentence 2, 4, 7] 2nd sentence is making an unexpected answer
  9.  [assumption] if someone is making an unexpected answer, he isn't normal
  10. [assumption] everyone should be normal
  11. [9, 8] the person that spoke the 2nd sentence isn't normal
  12. [10, 11] someone isn't normal, hence the joke

  Critics: I think setting up the "normal" person contradiction is too far(assuming that the joke is 
           caused by mad person). Stopping at "unexpected answer"(assume that the joke is caused by 
           unexpected behaviour) should be just enough, but I'm too lazy to change. 
           Assuming on "abnormal person" gets the advantage that we can easily attribute the contradiction
           to some person. For unexpected behavior we will attribute the contradiction to a sentence 
           maybe. 
           Actually on second thoughts, I think "what should be the benchmark for a joke?" should be
           the soul of the whole formalizarion: can we actually find a universal benchmark such that
           any jokes could be safely attributed to such claim. Only this will make the framework for 
           proving joke actually complete. *)

Two judges meet in a court and one is laughing hysterically.
The other: what's so funny?
The first one: i've just heard the most ridiculous anecdote of my life.
The other: Care to share?
The first: Can't, just gave a guy 15 years for it.
General idea:
- [assumption]if judge sent someone to jail for a reason, the reason with 
  the punishment constitutes to a rule
- Judge has made a rule that if someone tells a joke, he will be sent to prison
- If judge tells a joke, he will be sent to prison
- Judge cannot tell the joke

In the museum of Vasily Chapayev the guide shows the visitors a skeleton:
"And here you can see the skeleton of Vasily Chapayev."
"And what is this small skeleton next to him?"
"That's Vasily Chapayev in his childhood."
General idea:
- one person could have only one skeleton
- for exhibition and bluffing purpose, Vasily got 2x in the museum
- Museum has done wrong on Vasily
- Museum being abnormal, hence the joke

Andropov then head of KGB comes to see dying Brezhnev.
Brezhnev asks: Who do you think will be after me?
Andropov: I think, I will be.
B: But will the people follow you?

Russian and American go to hell. Satan approaches them, says:
â€“ Choose which hell you go to. There is Russian hell and American hell.
â€“ What is the difference? Both ask.
â€“ In American hell, you need to eat a bucket of shit once a day, and in Russian â€“ 2 buckets of shit, â€“ Satan answers.
â€“ Why do I have another bucket of shit? â€“ says the American, chooses the American hell.
â€“ Well, I lived in Russia, into the Russian hell and I will go, what is it, â€“ says the Russian, chooses the Russian hell.
They meet somehow after a while. Russian asks an American: â€“ Well, how are you in hell? â€“ Yes, good. I ate one bucket and walk all day. And you? â€“ Yes, as usual: there are not enough buckets for all, then they will bring little shit.
NOTE: More complicated implications than the 1st joke...
