# Coq Jokes
Best jokes in the world, formally verified.

For entertainments only, not for competitions.

## Features
- Whatever shouldn't be formalized, will be formalized.
- Don't solve the problems. Ask the questions.
- Don't vibe coding. Vibe proving.
- Don't formalize with cat theory. Formalize with proofs.
- Unfinished parts are left as exercises in courses.
- What are these hypotheses? Where did they come from?

## Run the proofs
```bash
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o CoqMakefile
make -f CoqMakefile
```

## TODO
Find some related papers from ProLaLa to decorate the readme.
